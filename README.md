# Maverik TimeSeries Forecasting Project
# Business Problem and Objective -

Maverik, a leading gasoline and retail convenience store chain in the western US, is in the midst of an expansion strategy, with plans to construct 30 new stores annually. A key element of their expansion success hinges on accurately predicting the revenue these new locations will generate in their first year. This prediction is vital for robust financial planning and ROI calculations. To tackle this challenge, our objective is to enhance Maverik's existing revenue prediction model. I aim to develop a forecasting system that provides precise daily sales estimates and an overall revenue projection for these new stores during their first year of operation. Achieving this level of forecasting accuracy is critical for Maverik's financial planning and decision-making processes.

# Solution to the business problem -

The methodology integrates a comprehensive amalgamation of advanced statistical techniques, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms, including Prophet, ETS, and XGBRegressor. This intricate approach involves a meticulous examination of diverse data sources, incorporating historical sales records, insights gleaned from recent store launches, and seasonal trends. The success of the project hinges on the precision of the forecasts, meticulously aligned with actual sales data and ROI metrics, thereby minimizing discrepancies and fortifying the model's robustness.Crucially, the project's focus deliberately centers on sales forecasting, specifically for new stores during their inaugural year. This intentional exclusion avoids considerations of other business facets and future projections. The project unfolds through a structured process, encompassing vital phases such as data cleansing, feature engineering, model training, and thorough evaluation. 

# Business Value of the Solution-

The implemented sales forecasting solution for Maverik holds significant business value by optimizing resource allocation, informing financial decisions, facilitating performance evaluation, mitigating risks, aiding strategic expansion planning, improving operational efficiency, and providing a competitive advantage. The accuracy of sales estimates enhances Maverik's ability to plan and execute new store launches effectively, contributing to overall business success and market competitiveness.

# Contribution to the Project -

I contributed significantly to the project by conducting in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), developing advanced time series forecasting models, and calculating rigorous evaluation metrics. Through these efforts, I empowered Maverik with data-driven decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and fostering continuous improvement. The iterative approach ensured that the forecasting models evolved over time, adapting to changing market conditions. 

# Difficulties that our group encountered along the way -

Our group encountered several challenges during the time series project. These included issues with data quality, complex seasonal patterns, dilemmas in model selection, limited historical data, external factors impacting sales, computational resource constraints, interpreting model outputs, and the need for continuous model maintenance. Overcoming these challenges required careful analysis, collaboration, and effective communication within the group. Despite the difficulties, our collective efforts and problem-solving skills contributed to the success of the project, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in handling complex time series analyses.

# Learnings in the project -

In conclusion, the time series project served as a rich learning experience, equipping our group with practical skills in data preprocessing, modeling,   continuous model maintenance, effective communication, collaboration, and adaptability. These learnings not only contribute to individual skill set but also enhance the collective ability to tackle complex analytical projects in the future.
